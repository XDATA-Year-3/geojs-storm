Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

Temperatures continued to average above normal. July was a good month for precipitation as there were multiple monsoonal and tropical influxes of moisture into the area. However, this wasn't nearly enough to impact the drought situation. Rainfall totals for Fresno received 0.43 of an inch of rain, while Bakersfield received 0.04 inches. ||The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report exceptional drought conditions across the entire Central California region. This extent of exceptional drought is extremely unusual for California. The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). For the calendar year, 2014 was the warmest year on record for Fresno and Bakersfield. The general trend of below normal precipitation and above normal temperatures has continued this year. ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, wells drying up in several communities leaving them with no water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. Also, communities in Central California interior face state mandated reductions in municipal water use.","","CSV"

The band of heavy snow continued across Oswego County through the middle of the day on the 31st before moving north toward Watertown in the afternoon.  The band remained across Jefferson and far northern Lewis County New Year???s Eve into New Year???s morning with subtle changes in wind direction forcing the band to meander several miles north and south at times.  The band occasionally split into two distinct bands of snow to the north and south of Watertown due to some shear, and also occasional upstream connections to bands from Lake Erie.  The snow became weak and disorganized for a few hours on the afternoon of New Year???s Day due to drier air and more shear over the lake.  The band of snow moved south on the night of January 1st and intensified across the Tug Hill region overnight.  Snowfall rates reached 2 to 3 inches per hour by early morning on January 2nd as it moved further southward across Oswego County before dissipating.

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces along Highway 81 from Geneva south to Hebron. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile. Significant impacts occurred with several portions of Interstate 80 being closed due to numerous traffic accidents. Some roads were restricted to one lane while other highways were closed due to white-out conditions over Clay, Fillmore, Nuckolls, Thayer, Webster counties. Adams county issued a no travel advisory. Nearly every school was closed Monday, February 2nd, east of a line from Ord to Franklin. This included the University of Nebraska at Kearney and Central Community College near Hastings. ||The initial wet snow Saturday occurred in warm air advection, in the entrance region of a 150 kt upper-level jet streak. The forcing for precipitation changed, however, as an arctic cold front sagged through Nebraska with lee cyclogenesis occurring ahead of it over southeastern Colorado. As the front continued moving south into Kansas Saturday night, the weak low left Colorado and progressed east along the front. It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States. This low formed as a result of a shortwave trough that came out of western Canada and amplified as it approached the longwave trough.","Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 4 to 7 inches.","CSV"

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces along Highway 81 from Geneva south to Hebron. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile. Significant impacts occurred with several portions of Interstate 80 being closed due to numerous traffic accidents.

The forcing for precipitation changed, however, as an arctic cold front sagged through Nebraska with lee cyclogenesis occurring ahead of it over southeastern Colorado. As the front continued moving south into Kansas Saturday night, the weak low left Colorado and progressed east along the front. It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States. This low formed as a result of a shortwave trough that came out of western Canada and amplified as it approached the longwave trough.","Storm total snowfall amounts ranged from 3 to 6 inches.","CSV"

It was located near Kansas City by daybreak Sunday and advanced east into Indiana by sunset. It was this low that was responsible for the majority of the snowfall accumulation which occurred Saturday night. The central pressure never lowered to less than 1005 mb and there was no deepening. However, the pressure gradient was significant northwest of the low, resulting in the strong winds. As with much of this winter, the flow aloft was split with a ridge along the West Coast, a closed low over the Desert Southwest, and confluent flow into the trough over the eastern United States.

The temperature profile was very marginal, but snow continued to fall through the day. Due to its persistence, some wet accumulations of 1 to 2 inches occurred on grassy surfaces along Highway 81 from Geneva south to Hebron. During the evening hours, snow became widespread as an organized snow band formed in the deformation zone of an intensifying low pressure center. Snow fell over nearly all of south central Nebraska for a time, but the heaviest and most persistent snow fell where it had been snowing during the daylight hours of Saturday, east of Highway 281. By 4 am CST Sunday, the accumulating snow ended and exited into southeast Nebraska. However, some smaller bands of light snow lingered through mid-morning. Storm total snowfall was generally 4 to 8 inches along and east of Highway 281. The highest amount of 9 inches was measured just north of Aurora. As the snow ended, north winds dramatically increased as the low pressure system organized. Winds were sustained around 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph. The cooling of the temperature profile allowed for the snow character to become drier after sunset. The result was significant blowing and drifting that lasted through the afternoon hours. Blizzard conditions occurred, at times, with the visibility down to one-quarter mile. Significant impacts occurred with several portions of Interstate 80 being closed due to numerous traffic accidents. Some roads were restricted to one lane while other highways were closed due to white-out conditions over Clay, Fillmore, Nuckolls, Thayer, Webster counties. Adams county issued a no travel advisory. Nearly every school was closed Monday, February 2nd, east of a line from Ord to Franklin. This included the University of Nebraska at Kearney and Central Community College near Hastings. ||The initial wet snow Saturday occurred in warm air advection, in the entrance region of a 150 kt upper-level jet streak.
